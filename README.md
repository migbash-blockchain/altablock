This is an example of a DeFI Blockchain structure using the BlockMatrix Structure.
---

## Motivation:

Solving the GDPR concerns within the blockchain industry to in reaction to the 2018 European
law stating the key points in placing user privacy 1st and the so called "Right to be forgotten", 
if the user decides to opt out of their data (pseudonyms or referential) stored on the blockchain.

## Project Structure

This project is built upon the Spring Boot (Java) Framework with a in-built UI panel for easier interface and
visualization of the Blockchain (Blockmatrix).

## Features

- Send Transactions to other People on the network with a valid/existing public wallet address.
- Ability to modify or delete your transactions information __after__ it has been sent & validated by the network, (only if you are the owner of that particular transaction)
- A fully working so called "Block Explorer", where you can view the _state_ of the BlockMatrix, with statistics such as:
    - Number of Blocks on the Network (inside the Block-Matrix/Blockchain),
    - Number of "tampered"/"modified" blocks transaction information in the entire "BlockMatrix",
    - All transaction made on the BlockChain / BlockMatrix,
    
## Getting Set-up

1. Download / clone the repository to your local computer,
2. Open this file in your IDE or text-editor,
3. Run the Application.class Main app.

OR

You can download and run the Java.exe located [here]() or in the [/release_branch]().
